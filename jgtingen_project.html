    <h2> Option 1 </h2>
    <section>
    <p> I would like to create a new theme for my portfolio - https://joliet.github.io/.
      The portfolio is build with a Jekyll theme that I modified.  Ultimately, I would like to make even more changes
      to the project page layout, default styles for headings, and other styles that don't fit how I would like to
      format the content.</p>
    </section>
    <h2> Option 2 </h2>
    <section>
    <p> I'm interested in bulding two custom WordPress themes that can be used as course templates for faculty at Duke
      (I work at Duke in Learning Tehcnologies). These would be similar to the layout and options we use in the
      templates we provide in the learning management system.
